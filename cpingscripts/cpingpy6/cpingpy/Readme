Connection Time Measurement Script (cping.py)
=============================================
cping.py measures the connection time between a source machine and a list of target IP addresses. 
It helps you analyze the responsiveness of different hosts and record their connection times.

Prerequisites
=============================================
Python 3.x

Input file containing target IP addresses (one per line)
=============================================
Create a text file named input_ips.txt in the same directory as the script. 
Add each target IP address you want to measure, one per line.

Example input_ips.txt:

8.8.8.8
10.0.0.1


Run the script:
=============================================
Open a terminal and navigate to the script's directory. 
Run the script using the following command:

python3 cping.py

View the results:
=============================================
The script will generate an output file named connection_times.txt in the same directory. 
This file will contain the timestamp, source ip, target IP, and connection time in microseconds for each target IP address.

Example connection_times.txt:
"2023-08-08 15:31:00","192.168.1.2","8.8.8.8","5.678"
"2023-08-08 15:32:00","192.168.1.2","10.0.0.1","-1"

Connection times are in microseconds. 
If a connection attempt fails, the connection time will be "-1".

Customization
=============================================
You can modify the target_port variable in the script to change the port number used for the connection attempt (default is 22).
You can modify the timeout variable in the script to change the connection timeout in seconds used for the connection attempt (default is 18).
function measure_connection_time returns the connection create time (3 way handshake) 
If you want to include the connection close time as well change the code to return connection_open_close_time
